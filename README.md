# Cafe Casa Martinez
[Cafe Casa Martinez](https://www.cafecasamartinez.com/) is a small, organic coffee brand from a farm in the Santander department of Colombia. Three varieties of coffee, Castillo, Tabi, and Cenicafe 1 are grown there in 11 lots of land. These varieties grow in the shade and only fruit once per year. The plants typically flower between February and April and produce fully ripened fruits between October and December.

These coffee plants produce fruit (from which beans are extracted) at a fraction of their max productivity that depends on the number of years since the tree has been planted or renewed. In the year of planting and the year after planting, no fruit is produced. In the second year after sowing, the plant will produce 50% of its maximum production. The third year sees maximum fruit production, and each year after that decreases. For this reason, in the 6th year after sowing the plant may be cut near its base. This process is called renewing, or zoca, and it returns the plant to maximum production after two more years. Plants may be renewed up to 5 times. 

The maximum production of a plant depends on the soil, rainfall, climate, and available sunlight. It is not known, in general without empirical measurement from the plants in a given lot.
