# Cafe Casa Martinez
[Cafe Casa Martinez](https://www.cafecasamartinez.com/) is a small, organic coffee farm in the Santander department of Colombia. They grow three varieties of coffee, Castillo, Tabi, and Cenicafe 1. These varieties grow in the shade and only fruit once per year. The plants typically flower between February and April and produce fully ripened fruits between October and December.

Coffee plants produce fruit (from which beans are extracted) at a fraction of their max productivity that depends on the number of years since the tree has been planted or renewed. In the year of planting and the year after planting year +1, a negligible amount of fruit is produced.
